## Description

The HTML code in this document creates a web page with nested tables, showcasing various table structures and basic styling. It's a simple example for educational purposes and can serve as a starting point for more complex table-based layouts.

## HTML Structure

The HTML document starts with the standard structure declaration and includes a `<head>` section where metadata and the page title are defined. The `<body>` section contains the content of the web page.

### Main Table

The main table is contained within a `<div>` element with the class "wrapper." It consists of two rows, each with two cells (`<td>`). These cells contain nested tables.

#### Nested Table 1

The first cell contains a nested table labeled "Nested Table 1." Inside this table, there is a list (`<ul>`) with three list items (`<li>`).

#### Nested Table 2

The second cell contains a nested table labeled "Nested Table 2." This table has two rows and two columns, with sample content in each cell.

### Styling

The web page applies basic styling using inline CSS within the `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section.

- The main table has a 1px black border and a fixed width of 250px.
- Cells (`<td>`) within tables have a 1px black border.
- Some cells use inline styles to remove borders (e.g., `style="border: 0;"`).
